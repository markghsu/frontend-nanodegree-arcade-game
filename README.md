#Frogger Arcade Game

This game is a clone of the popular "Frogger" arcade game. In it, the player will try to move across the screen from the green grass to the water, while avoiding enemy bugs and collecting powerups.

##Gameplay
The user will first select a character by using the arrow keys. Once a character is selected, the level will load. The player will move the character around using arrow keys. Every time the player hits a bug, they will lose one life. Everytime they reach the water at the top of the screen, they will gain 10 points.

##Powerups
Gems, hearts, and keys are powerups that the player can collect to get more points or more lives. These are worth varying amounts of points.

##Levels
At the current time, only the first two levels have been designed. After that, levels are generated by randomly placing enemies on the playing field, increasing in number every level.

##Future development
In the future, the following features are planned:
- level loader
- level editor
- more powerups
- obstacles and different uses for keys

##About this Project
This game was created for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree, project 3.
